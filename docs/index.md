title: The Evolution of Gender and Ethnic Representation in Cinema
subtitle: Analyzing diversity trends in the film industry
---

# Motivation 

The evolution of gender, ethnic and other apparent physical features representation in cinema serves as a lens reflecting societal values and cultural shifts over decades. In this project, we seek to explore these dynamics by analyzing the physical characteristics of main actors‚Äîgender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, height, and age‚Äîacross decades and genres, using the CMU movie summary corpus as our main data source. Together, we will investigate how specific archetypes emerge, evolve, and influence genre conventions and movie revenues, shedding light on diversity‚Äôs role in shaping audience engagement and the movie industry in general.    
By examining trends in character archetypes in the movie industry, we aim to identify shifts in societal norms and values, allowing us to better understand the role of cinema in mirroring and potentially driving cultural changes.


# Introduction

Hello reader,  
Do you know that 5 out of 4 people struggle with math?  
...Wait, what?!  
    
While this joke has nothing to do with the project, something curious happens as you read this text. You probably hear a voice in your head‚Äîdon‚Äôt worry, that‚Äôs just me, your narrator. I am here to guide you through this data story, where every number and insight reveals a new chapter. Follow me, I will be your tour guide.     

Let me brief you first : Did you notice that in today's movies, we see more and more characters representing diverse ethnicities, sexual orientations, gender identities, and physical features?    

The growing number of movies and TV shows featuring LGBTQ+ characters, diverse ethnicities, and varying gender identities reflects a significant shift in societal attitudes.  The modern audience, especially younger generations (Millennials and Gen Z), demand inclusivity and are willing to support films that reflect diverse experiences. And the movie industry understood the assignment!  According to a 2018 McKinsey & Company study and subsequent reports from the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, movies with diverse casts consistently outperform those with less representation. In fact, films with casts that are 41‚Äì50% diverse earned, on average, $26.8 million more in global box office revenue compared to those with less than 11% diversity.    

Thankfully, today's society is more open and inclusive, embracing stories that represent a broader spectrum of human experiences. But was it always the case?    

Obviously not! Fifty or sixty years ago, representation of LGBTQ+ characters, racial diversity, and non-conforming gender identities in movies was far less common‚Äîand often met with strong resistance. Societal norms, censorship, and prejudices limited the stories that could be told and the characters that could be represented. In the United States, the Hays Code (1934‚Äì1968) regulated movie content, prohibiting explicit depictions of sexuality, ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù behavior, and any form of homosexuality, which was labeled as "sexual perversion." As a result, LGBTQ+ characters were either omitted, villainized, or their identities were subtly implied through coded language or stereotypes.    

By using movie revenue as a metric to assess how well a movie was received by the public, we aim to analyze the archetypes of characters portrayed in successful movies, shedding light on the audience's evolving interests and preferences, and thus offering insights into how societal norms and perceptions have shifted over the years.


# A few words on our analysis :

You‚Äôve probably figured it out by now: our study relies heavily on movie revenue to uncover trends. And yes, I can already hear the criticism coming from miles away: ‚ÄúBut how can you compare movies from different eras? You need to adjust for inflation and time value of money!"    

Relax, nerds, we‚Äôve got you covered. To ensure our analysis is solid, we split the data into smaller time frames (5 years each). This allows us to draw meaningful conclusions while conveniently sidestepping the pesky effects of inflation and the changing value of money over time.

Alright, let‚Äôs get serious for a moment. Your concern is completely valid: by computing the Pearson correlation between movie revenue and release year, I found a correlation of 0.19, meaning that movie release date HAS an influence on revenue. This observation is made obvious simply by looking at the graph of average movie revenue per year - as recent movies tend to generate significantly higher revenues :

While such an increase can be explained by democratization of cinema over the years,  time value of money also plays an important role. In fact, we estimate that $100 in the early 1900‚Äôs corresponds to a purchasing power of nearly $3800 today!    

In order to account for all these effects, we chose to split our analysis into 5-year periods. This approach not only helps us overcome the inflation and other time-related issues, but also allows us to detect how the impact of each of our features (gender representation, ethnic representation, movie genre, etc.) on movie revenue evolves over time‚Äîbecause, as we‚Äôll see, their influence isn‚Äôt static; it changes with the years!    

Moreover, due to data imbalance when it comes to movie release language, I decided to focus only on movies released in English (I would expect our model to fail to determine meaningful relationships between movie language and movie revenue anyways due to lack of data in some languages). WITNESS THE IMBALANCE ! üò±

# Effects of Diversity on Movie Revenue : 

Before further diving into our story, here is a picture of Patagonia, Argentina :

Isn‚Äôt it lovely ? ü•∞ While Patagonia does not have anything to do with the project, studies suggest that reader‚Äôs attention tends to fade away after 6 minutes of reading. By putting an image of beautiful Patagonia, I wanted to surprise your brain and fully reengage you in the lecture of our story! (This method was used by an amazing Statistics professor at EPFL (sorry I forgot his name)  in the undergraduate course Probabilities & Statistics, and it has proven very efficient!)    

<span style="color: red;">Back on the track!</span>

In order to convince you about the importance of diversity representation in cinema, take a look at the Spearman correlation matrix I made just for you ü•∞ : 

![Spearman Corr](/assets/img/plots/spearman-corr-matrix.png)

Notice anything special ? The gender ratio, as well as the presence of some ethnicities such as actors from Jewish communities or African American ethnicities are positively correlated with the movie revenue (with a Spearman correlation of 0.20 and 0.26 respectively with movie revenue). Besides, movie genres seem also to affect the movie revenue, but I kept this chapter of our story  for later, so stay tuned!    

Ah! Just before I forget : computing the Spearman correlation instead of the Pearson correlation WAS a choice. In fact, Spearman correlation is better suited to detect monotonic, but not necessarily linear relationships, thus providing more robust results. ‚Äúrobuster‚Äù? ‚Äúmore robust‚Äù?   Well , you get the idea.    

## How does the ratio of female actresses in the movie cast influences the revenue ? 

üéµRoses are red, Violets are blue üé∂ The ratio of female has an influence on the movie revenue !    

![revenue per F-ratio](/assets/img/plots/F-ratio-revenue.png)

According to our analysis conducted on the entire dataset (i.e. without accounting for time dependent trends), it appears that while too many female actresses (in proportion) in a movie cast is not good for the overall revenue, not having enough (too few!) is also very bad! 

This reveals a lot about the depiction of women in cinema and, by extension, broader societal norms. The fact that having "too many" female actresses negatively impacts revenue suggests that Hollywood (since we only considered movies in english)‚Äîand audiences‚Äîview women as secondary characters, rather than leads driving the story. It reflects a bias where female representation beyond a certain threshold is seen as deviating from the "norm," which has long been dominated by male-centric narratives.

On the other hand, the sharp drop in revenue when there are too few women highlights an expectation for female presence, likely as a means of fulfilling traditional or stereotypical roles‚Äîlove interests, sidekicks, or supporting characters‚Äîrather than as central, multi-dimensional figures.
In short, this trend underscores a lingering imbalance: while cinema and society have accepted a certain level of female representation, it remains confined within limits that align with historical gender roles. Breaking these boundaries would require challenging deeply ingrained perceptions of who gets to be at the forefront of storytelling.

## What about the revenue per ethnic group ? 

Now that we've explored gender, let‚Äôs turn to another key question: what about revenue across ethnic groups? Are certain ethnicities more prominently featured in box office hits? As you might guess, the data speaks volumes‚Äîso let‚Äôs take a closer look at how revenue aligns (or doesn‚Äôt) with the representation of different ethnic groups on screen.

![revenue per ethnicity](/assets/img/plots/Revenue-per-ethnicity.png)

The plot reveals a relatively balanced average revenue per ethnic group, with some minor variations. Movies featuring Asian ethnicities and Indigenous Peoples perform slightly better, leading the chart in average revenue. This could be attributed to the growing appeal of Asian markets and the global reception of culturally significant or unique stories. Meanwhile, groups such as Middle Eastern and Arab, European, and African ethnicities fall closely behind, showing only small differences in average earnings.  

Overall, the revenue distribution across ethnic groups appears fairly consistent, with no striking imbalance. This suggests that movies featuring diverse ethnicities have similar earning potential, reflecting openness among audiences to embrace and engage with stories representing a variety of cultures.

## And for  the revenue per movie genre ?

Are all genres created equal when it comes to box office success, or do some consistently outshine the rest? From action-packed blockbusters to heartfelt dramas, let‚Äôs explore which genres bring in the big bucks and which ones struggle to capture audiences‚Äô wallets‚Äîand hearts.

![revenue per ethnicity](/assets/img/plots/Revenue-per-genre.png)

Wow, well that‚Äôs surprising! At the very top, Animation absolutely dominates, raking in the highest average revenue‚Äîno surprise there, given its universal appeal, family-friendly nature, and blockbuster franchises that pull in audiences worldwide. 

Close behind, we see Fantasy and Science Fiction, Adventure, and Family and Children genres thriving, powered by big budgets, epic storytelling, and dedicated fanbases. 

But here's where it gets interesting: genres like Drama, Musicals and Dance, and LGBT and Gender Issues sit much lower, suggesting that despite their critical acclaim or cultural importance, they struggle to compete financially. And at the very bottom, Experimental and Independent films bring in the least revenue‚Äîno shock, but still a reminder of the uphill battle smaller, niche films face. 

An explanation for this observation‚Äîand one we‚Äôll explore in more detail later‚Äîis that some genres, such as LGBT and Gender Issues, have only recently gained traction and popularity. For much of cinema history, they may have struggled to draw audiences, partly due to a social climate that was less open to their themes or narratives. As societal attitudes evolved, these genres began to find their place, but their earlier struggles are still reflected in their lower average revenues.

All in all, it‚Äôs clear that when it comes to revenue, big, bold, and visually immersive genres steal the show, leaving the quieter categories fighting for their share of the spotlight.


# Evolution of Trends in the movie industry and what they reflect on society

We spoke bulk, now let‚Äôs speak trends!

To further analyze the impact of gender representation, ethnic representation, and movie genres on movie revenue across the years, we ran multiple Ridge regressions while focusing on the statistically significant features with highest effect on the movie revenue (at the 5% significance level). Recall that we use movie revenue as a proxy that measures what the audience likes to see, and thus mirrors social and cultural trends in society! ü§ì

To account for potential non-linearity caused by time dependence (e.g., a feature that strongly influenced revenue in 1900 may not have the same effect in 2000), we segmented our data into 5-year time periods. This approach allows us to capture how the influence of these features on movie revenue evolves over time.

The plots below showcase the top 5 most influential features with a positive effect on the revenue for movies released since 1985, providing insights into the key factors driving box office performance during that specific period.
